Branching, merging, and rebasing are fundamental starting points for understanding how to manage your work in codelines. A branch allows you to make changes in a working copy so you can indpendently validate those changes - a bug fix, a UI modification you need to demo, a version of the software for a dog-and-pony show for management, etc.

Branching is a common concept in source code control, and is supported in any SCC platform worth talking about. However, the client-server delta-storage architecture of centralized repository platforms usually means limitations on how you collaborate. Usually just the "branch and merge" workflow is supported, and other models like the "promotion" model are discouraged. Over time, as mentioned on the previous page, your codelines can become difficult to manage.

                    A common problem is how to deal with merges. In a <em>pessimistic</em> SCC platform, like Visual SourceSafe used to be, you would <i>lock</i> files or entire codelines so you could make changes and commit them back without worrying that someone changed the same files. This is basically a long-running transaction, and creates bottlenecks for collaboration. Most all scalable SCC platforms support <em>optimistic</em> semantics, meaning many developers may checkout the code and work on it concurrently. Of course the issue here is if you attempt to port your local changes back to the main codeline, someone else may have beaten you to it. You are then responsible for merging not only your changes from a known point (when you checked out), but now porting those changes to your colleague's changes as well. SCC platforms typically support some form of auto-merge, but usually if you have edited the same artifacts (files) you end up with conflicts you must resolve manually. As this can be laborious, the mantra is to "check in early and check in often", to minimize the size and scope of manual merges. Another technique is to merge in a separate branch distinct from the mainline, to ensure the merges go as planned, and the backport en masse to the mainline. Suprisingly, this is non-trivial with traditional centralized SCC platforms. The power of distributed version control systems (DVCMS) is the ability to do this easily. In fact, Git enables the ability to define flexible workflows to enforce merging strategies together with quality policies on codelines.
